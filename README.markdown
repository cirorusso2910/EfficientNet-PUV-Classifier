# ü©ª EfficientNet-PUV-Classifier üß¨

This repository provides the official implementation of a deep learning pipeline 
for the automatic classification of **Posterior Urethral Valves** (**PUV**) from **Voiding CystoUrethroGram** (**VCUG**) images, 
based on **EfficientNet** **architectures**.

**Posterior Urethral Valves** (**PUV**) are a rare congenital anomaly affecting the male urethra. 
Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial to prevent serious complications, including renal damage. 
This project aims to **support the diagnostic process** by exploiting _Convolutional Neural Networks_ (_CNN_) to identify PUV cases directly from imaging data.

## üåç Impact and Relevance
- Contributes to the **early diagnosis of PUV**, which is essential to avoid long-term renal complications.
- Provides a **reproducible framework** that can be adapted or extended to other urological conditions.
- Promotes **collaboration** between **clinicians** and **AI researchers**, bridging the gap between computer vision and healthcare.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset
The dataset used in this study originates from a real-world acquisition campaign conducted within the activity of the [SUD4VUP project](https://sites.google.com/view/sud4vup/home), coordinated by the University of Campania ‚ÄúLuigi Vanvitelli‚Äù. <br>
The data collection involved the Nephrology and Urology Units at ["Luigi Vanvitelli" University Hospital](https://www.policliniconapoli.it/home), [AORN Santobono-Pausilipon](https://www.santobonopausilipon.it) in Naples, and [IRCCS Ca‚Äô Granda](https://www.policlinico.mi.it) in Milan. <br>
The dataset includes routine **VCUG acquisitions** from **male pediatric patients**, each labeled to indicate the presence or absence of **Posterior Urethral Valves** (**PUV**).

### üîê Data Availability
Due to privacy regulations and clinical data protection protocols, **the dataset is not publicly available**. 
However, preprocessing scripts and data handling instructions are included to support reproducibility using compatible datasets.

Researchers interested in collaboration or data access for institutional research purposes may contact the **project coordinators**.

  abstract = {Posterior Urethral Valves (PUV) are the leading cause of lower urinary tract obstruction in male infants. Diagnosis relies on Voiding CystoUrethroGraphy (VCUG) and invasive    cystoscopy, which, despite being the gold standard, poses anesthesia and procedural risks, underscoring the need for a non-invasive, imaging-based screening tool. In this study, we investigate whether recent Deep Learning (DL) architectures can identify PUV directly from routine VCUG images, offering a non-invasive alternative. We present the design and implementation of a novel DL-based framework, trained and validated on a real-world multicenter dataset of $403$ VCUG acquisitions, previously annotated by pediatric urologists. In the binary classification task (PUV vs. non-PUV), EfficientNet-B0 achieved the highest overall accuracy of $68.3\%$. To promote clinical interpretability, we integrated Grad-CAM to generate attention maps, verifying that the model was indeed focusing on relevant discriminative features. This enhances the reliability of the system and supports its potential clinical adoption. The results demonstrate the feasibility of automated PUV classification from VCUG using DL, laying a solid groundwork for future development toward non-invasive screening tools in real-world clinical applications.}
