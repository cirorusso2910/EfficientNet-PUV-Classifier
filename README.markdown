# ü©ª EfficientNet-PUV-Classifier üß¨

This repository provides the official implementation of a deep learning pipeline 
for the automatic classification of **Posterior Urethral Valves** (**PUV**) from **Voiding CystoUrethroGram** (**VCUG**) images, 
based on **EfficientNet** **architectures**.

**Posterior Urethral Valves** (**PUV**) are a rare congenital anomaly affecting the male urethra. 
Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial to prevent serious complications, including renal damage. 
This project aims to **support the diagnostic process** by exploiting _Convolutional Neural Networks_ (_CNN_) to identify PUV cases directly from imaging data.

## üåç Impact and Relevance
- Contributes to the **early diagnosis of PUV**, which is essential to avoid long-term renal complications.
- Provides a **reproducible framework** that can be adapted or extended to other urological conditions.
- Promotes **collaboration** between **clinicians** and **AI researchers**, bridging the gap between computer vision and healthcare.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset
The dataset used in this study originates from a real-world acquisition campaign conducted within the activity of the [SUD4VUP project](https://sites.google.com/view/sud4vup/home), coordinated by the University of Campania ‚ÄúLuigi Vanvitelli‚Äù. <br>
The data collection involved the Nephrology and Urology Units at ["Luigi Vanvitelli" University Hospital](https://www.policliniconapoli.it/home), [AORN Santobono-Pausilipon](https://www.santobonopausilipon.it) in Naples, and [IRCCS Ca‚Äô Granda](https://www.policlinico.mi.it) in Milan. <br>
The dataset includes routine **VCUG acquisitions** from **male pediatric patients**, each labeled to indicate the presence or absence of **Posterior Urethral Valves** (**PUV**).

### üîê Data Availability
Due to privacy regulations and clinical data protection protocols, **the dataset is not publicly available**. 
However, preprocessing scripts and data handling instructions are included to support reproducibility using compatible datasets.

Researchers interested in collaboration or data access for institutional research purposes may contact the **project coordinators**.
